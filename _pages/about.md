I am Bo, an assistant professor at Hohai University, [School of Earth Sciences and Engineering](https://dxy.hhu.edu.cn), focusing on shallow subsurface environment observation and evaluation. For sustainability, I focus on promoting the large-scale utilization of shallow geothermal energy in heating and cooling.

### Education
- Doctor of Engineering: Geological Resources and Geological Engineering at Nanjing University (2020-2024)
- Master's study: Geological Engineering at Nanjing University (2018-2020, pursue doctoral study in advance)
- Bachelor of Engineering: Engineering Geology at Jilin University (2013-2017)

### An overview of my research and interests
Iâ€™m an engineering geology researcher specializing in shallow subsurface environment observation and evaluation. The observation factors mainly include ground temperature, thermal conductivity, and unsaturated or saturated water movement observation. The evaluation based on the geostatistic aims to model the continuous distribution with always limited observation. My research explores efficient in-situ observation methods and regional modeling frameworks for reliable evaluation. With sufficient observation and  evaluation, I am interested in the forming mechanisms of the complex shallow subsurface environment under both nature and humanity from multiple scales.
